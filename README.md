### What is this? ###

At some point during the pursuit of my first bachelor's degree, I realized something was wrong. I was simply going through the motions of getting out of bed, listening to lectures, completing assignments, and getting back into bed. I found myself at a crossroads: my heart told me to learn CS, but it seemed too late to change the course of my undergraduate degree. At the same time, I didn't feel quite ready to move onto a master's degree. After some research, I learned that obtaining a second undergraduate degree in CS may be the best thing to do.

To my dismay, choosing which schools to apply to turned out to be no easy task. A large number of university websites only mention policies regarding returning students, a few top schools explicitly turn away second degree applicants, and countless other institutions have their policies hidden amongst clutter or vague wording.

In an attempt to make this process easier for second degree seeking students (there are dozens of us, I swear!), I've begun compiling the relevant policies of a number of North American institutions.

Please enjoy, and do keep in mind that this document is meant only to serve as a reference. It is incomplete and may not be entirely up-to-date or accurate.

tl;dr: It's a list of schools and their policies regarding second bachelor's degrees in computer science.

### How can I contribute? ###

I'll try to look up more policies when I have time, but I'd appreciate all the help I can get.

1. Fork this repository.
2. Edit README.md ([Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/tchapi/markdown-cheatsheet/blob/master/README.md))
3. Open a pull request!

**Guidelines**: Whenever possible, directly quote a university's website or an official representative of a university when contributing a policy. Include in your pull request a link/screenshot to the original wording if you can. Thanks!

### A Note on School Rankings ###

In the hopes of maintaining objectivity, the schools listed below are ranked a la Emery Berger's [CSRankings](http://csrankings.org) ordering of North American institutions, based on their publication quality and output between the years 2000 and 2018.
